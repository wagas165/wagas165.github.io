I am a senior undergraduate student in the Mathematics Talent Program at Fudan University and a Research Assistant at the Research Institute of Intelligent Complex Systems.
My research focuses on developing frameworks that bridge model-driven and data-driven approaches in complex systems. I am particularly interested in optimization and machine learning methods for dynamical systems, with an emphasis on combining physical principles with neural network architectures to enhance system modeling and control.
