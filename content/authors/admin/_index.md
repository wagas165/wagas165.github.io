awards:
  - title: "DetGNN: ADeterministic Feature-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for Modeling Higher-order Interactions"
    date: 2023-09-01
    summary: |
      - Instructed by Wei Lin, Fudan University. 
      - Introducd deterministic features that improve prediction accuracy and established a new paradigm for modeling and predicting complex systems. 
      - Broke the limitation of traditional information passing, enabling information exchange across multiple nodes and edges - simultaneously, capturing higher-order interactions beyond direct adjacency. 
      - Provided a rigorous theoretical framework for handling randomness and uncertainty in complex networks. 
      - Wrote a paper and currently finalizing results for submission to ICML 2025. 
  - title: "TimePhiBE: A Time-dependent PDE-Based Bellman Equation for Continuous-Time Policy Evaluation"
    date: 2024-04-01
    summary: |
      - Instructed by Yuhua Zhu, University of California, Los Angeles. 
      - Developed a time-dependent PDE-based framework that generalizes existing policy evaluation methods to handle dynamic, time-varying systems in reinforcement learning, including scenarios with discount factors. 
      - Provided rigorous theoretical guarantees, including error bounds and high-order approximations for both deterministic and stochastic cases. 
      - Demonstrated the framework’s value in generalizing to diverse dynamic scenarios and its superior accuracy. 
      - Wrote a paper and currently finalizing results for submission to NeurIPS 2025.
