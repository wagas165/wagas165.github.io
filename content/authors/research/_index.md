    summary: |
      - Developed a time-dependent PDE-based framework that generalizes existing policy evaluation methods to handle dynamic, time-varying systems in reinforcement learning, including scenarios with discount factors.
      - Established the first known theoretical results on error bounds for time-varying continuous-time policy evaluation, providing rigorous guarantees for both first-order and high-order approximations in dynamic systems.
      - Extended the framework to handle time-varying dynamics while maintaining its theoretical guarantees, significantly improving the applicability to real-world time-dependent control problems.
      - Wrote a paper and currently finalizing results for submission to NeurIPS 2025.
